        <h2 class="title">SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HUMANS AND THE OCEAN IN COMPOSITION</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Both humans and the ocean share a striking similarity: they are composed largely of water. Approximately 70%
          of the human body is made up of water, mirroring the fact that 70% of Earth's surface is covered by oceans.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Just as the ocean is rich in minerals essential for marine life, the human body relies on similar minerals
          like sodium, magnesium, and potassium for vital cellular processes. These elements circulate through both
          ecosystems and bodies, maintaining balance and sustaining life.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          The salinity of human blood is nearly identical to the salinity of seawater, showcasing a deep evolutionary
          connection that binds us to the marine environment. This remarkable similarity reminds us of our shared
          origins and interdependence with the ocean.

            Olympic-sized swimming pools every second.

            the body.
